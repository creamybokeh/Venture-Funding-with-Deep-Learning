# Venture-Funding-with-Deep-Learning

This program helps predict whether applicants to a venture capital firm will be successful if funded. It was written for Alphabet Soup, a venture capital firm. The program runs historical data of startup successes and failures thorough a binary classifier model that helps predict whether an applicant will become a successful business. The program preprocesses data for a neural netowrk model, uses the model-fit-predict pattern to compile and evaluate a binary classificaiton model and then optimizes the model by running several additional models with differnet parameters for comparison.

## Technologies

This application is compatible with Python 3.9.
It is a Juypter Notebook file that has been created and run inside of Google Colab.

Find out about and sign up for Google Colab [here.](https://colab.research.google.com)

The tensorflow, sklearn and pandas libraries must be installed prior to using.

Pandas is used for data science and analysis and machine learning.

Pathlib is used point Python to file paths. If you are running this program through Juypter Lab you will need to import this dependency.

TensorFlow is a software library used for numerical computation with data flow graphs. TensorFlow allows application of deep learning across numerous areas using perceptual and language-understanding tasks.

Sklearn (scikit-learn) is a Python library that provides a wide range of unsupervised and supervised machine learning algorithms.

This program will work on Windows, MacOS and Linux with Python 3.9 installed. The user will need to run the program in a code editor such as Juypter Lab or Visual Studio Code.

Documentation for the Pandas library can be found [here.](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/)

Documentation for the pathlib library can be found[here.](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html)

Documentation for TensorFlow can be found [here.](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/)

Documentation for Sklearn can be found [here.](https://matplotlib.org/stable/index.html](https://scikit-learn.org/0.21/documentation.html)

## Installation Guide

Install the following dependencies before running the program.

To install the pathlib, pandas, sklearn and tensorflow libraries type the following into your CLI:

```
python
pip install pandas
pip install pathlib
pip install -U scikit-learn
pip install tensorflow
```

## Usage

To run the program open Google Colab and click on "File" then "Upload Notebook". Locate the Juypter Notebook file and choose it.

The program will load and you can then run the cells in sequence from top to bottom.

The outputs display various points of detailed analysis of the summary data so the user can see how each model performs.
